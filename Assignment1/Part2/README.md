# PART 2 - Come Together (Beatles anyone?)

### DEPENDENCIES
Part 1 Completion

### REQUIREMENT
Create a bash script that undoes Part1 in a modified way that is reverse order. Words beginning with z will be at the beggining of words.txt and words that begin with a will be at the end.

1. Copy all subdirectories from Part1 directory into the Part2 directory. Make sure not to copy over words.txt and README.md.

2. Recreate words.txt by iterating the letter subdirectories, this time from z to a. Take word contents of each sortedwords.txt in each subdirectory and concatenate them into words.txt in Part2 directory.

3. Remove all letter subdirectories once the words.txt is populated with all the sortedwords.txt contents.

# PART 1
Sort Words

## REQUIREMENT
For every first letter in each word, not case sensitive, place the corresponding word into a subdirectory within this one that begins with that letter.

## EXAMPLE
If the word list consists of:

cat
catch
dog
zebra

Create subdirectories c,d, and z.
Create the file sortedwords.txt in each subdirectory.
Concatenate each word that begins with the letter of the subdirectory into each sortedwords.txt file. The sortedwords.txt file in the c subdirectory will contain: cat, catch. The sortedwords.txt file in d subdirectory will contain: dog. The sortedwords.txt file in the z subdirectory will contain: zebra.
